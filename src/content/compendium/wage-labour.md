## What Is Wage Labour?

Wage labour describes the relationship where workers, lacking ownership of productive resources, must sell their labour power to capitalists in exchange for wages. This exchange appears voluntary and fair but enables systematic extraction of [surplus value](/compendium/surplus-value).

## Historical Context

Wage labour became dominant through [primitive accumulation](/compendium/primitive-accumulation) that separated people from land and traditional livelihoods. Enclosures, colonialism, and debt dispossession forced populations into labour markets where selling one's capacity to work became necessary for survival.

## Key Characteristics

- Workers do not own what they produce
- Compensation covers less value than workers create
- Employment appears as voluntary contract
- Labour power becomes a commodity

## Modern Forms

- Gig platform workers paid per task
- Precarious service sector employment
- Global supply chain labour
- Nominally self-employed contractors with no autonomy

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Wage labour produces [alienation](/compendium/alienation) by separating workers from control over their work. It enables [capital accumulation](/compendium/capital-accumulation) through extracting surplus value. [Socialism](/compendium/socialism) aims to abolish wage labour by establishing [social ownership](/compendium/social-ownership) and democratic control over production. The [labour theory of value](/compendium/labour-theory-of-value) explains how wage labour generates profit.
