## What Is Democratic Centralism?

Democratic centralism proposes that political organisations should allow open discussion and debate during decision-making but require unified action once the majority decides. Members can argue positions internally but must implement collective decisions externally, maintaining organisational discipline and coherence.

## Historical Context

Lenin developed this principle for the Bolsheviks operating under Tsarist repression, arguing revolutionary organisations needed both democratic participation and coordinated action. Many communist parties and socialist organisations adopted variations, though implementation often privileged centralism over democracy.

## Key Components

- Free internal discussion during decision-making
- Democratic voting on contested positions
- Binding majority decisions on all members
- Unified external action and messaging
- Right to continue advocating minority positions internally

## Modern Debates

Critics argue democratic centralism enabled authoritarian control, stifled dissent, and concentrated power in leadership. Defenders contend effective political organisation requires coordination and discipline impossible through purely horizontal structures. Contemporary movements experiment with modified approaches.

## Relationship to Other Concepts

[Vanguard parties](/compendium/vanguard-party) typically employed democratic centralism as organisational method. It differs from horizontal decision-making in [Zapatismo](/compendium/zapatismo) and anarchist movements. [Praxis](/compendium/praxis) requires some coordination between theory and action that democratic centralism attempts to provide.
