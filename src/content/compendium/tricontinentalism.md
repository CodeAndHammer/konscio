## What Is Tricontinentalism?

Tricontinentalism describes the political coordination and mutual support among revolutionary movements in Africa, Asia, and Latin America during the 1960s-80s. It embodied the conviction that imperialism created unified conditions of exploitation across the Global South requiring coordinated resistance.

## Historical Context

The 1966 Tricontinental Conference in Havana brought together liberation movements, socialist states, and revolutionary organisations from across the Global South. Inspired by the [Bandung Conference](/compendium/bandung-conference), Cuban Revolution, and Vietnamese resistance, it formalized anti-imperial internationalism.

## Key Principles

- Unity of Global South liberation struggles
- Armed resistance against imperialism where necessary
- Socialist transformation of exploitative economies
- Mutual aid and solidarity between movements
- Opposition to both US and Soviet domination

## Historical Impact

Tricontinentalism supported liberation wars in Angola, Mozambique, Nicaragua, and elsewhere. It provided organisational, material, and ideological resources for anti-colonial and anti-imperialist struggles, demonstrating that revolutionary movements could coordinate across continents.

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Tricontinentalism extended [anti-imperialism](/compendium/anti-imperialism) and [internationalism](/compendium/internationalism) across the Global South. It built on [pan-Africanism](/compendium/pan-africanism) and [Third Worldism](/compendium/third-worldism) while advancing [decolonisation](/compendium/decolonisation). Examples include the [Cuban Revolution](/compendium/cuban-revolution), [Sankara's Burkina Faso](/compendium/sankaras-burkina-faso), and solidarity with [Allende's Chile](/compendium/allendes-chile).
