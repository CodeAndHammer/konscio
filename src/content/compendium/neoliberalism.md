## What Is Neoliberalism?

Neoliberalism is an ideology and policy framework that promotes free markets, privatisation, deregulation, and austerity. It reshapes society so that public goods, social rights, and collective institutions are replaced by market-driven systems where individuals compete for survival.

Rather than a retreat of the state, neoliberalism uses the state to enforce market rules, protect private property, and discipline labour.

## Historical Context

Neoliberalism emerged in the late 20th century as a reaction against post-war social democracy and decolonial experiments. It gained political power through leaders like Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, and through global institutions such as the IMF and World Bank.

Structural adjustment programs imposed neoliberal reforms on the Global South, forcing privatisation, cuts to social services, and the opening of markets to foreign capital. These policies deepened inequality and entrenched dependency.

## Core Features

- Privatisation of public services and resources
- Deregulation of finance and industry
- Austerity and cuts to social spending
- Weakening of labour rights and unions
- Transforming citizens into consumers
- Treating education, healthcare, and housing as markets
- Expanding corporate power in political decision-making

## Material Consequences

- Rising inequality and concentration of wealth
- Precarious work and gig labour systems
- Erosion of public infrastructure
- High household debt and financial stress
- Strengthened corporate influence in policy
- Environmental destruction accelerated by deregulation

## Neoliberalism in the Global South

Neoliberalism reinforces global hierarchies. Structural adjustment, resource concessions, and debt regimes lock poorer countries into extractive roles. This continues forms of [neocolonialism](/compendium/neocolonialism) and reinforces [unequal exchange](/compendium/unequal-exchange).

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Neoliberalism is incompatible with ecological survival. Its focus on growth, deregulation, and private accumulation worsens climate breakdown and blocks democratic planning needed for a [just transition](/compendium/just-transition). Eco-socialism rejects neoliberalism’s structure of power, advocating democratic control, public goods, and ecological limits.

## Why It Matters

Neoliberalism is not just a policy set. It is a worldview that shapes how people understand society, responsibility, and freedom. Recognising it as a political project makes it possible to imagine alternatives based on solidarity, public provision, and collective decision-making.
