## What Was the Cuban Revolution?

The Cuban Revolution, led by the July 26 Movement under figures like Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, overthrew the US-backed Batista regime in 1959. The revolution reorganised the economy around public ownership, agrarian reform, universal services, and anti-imperialist politics.

## Historical Context

Before 1959, Cuba’s economy was dominated by foreign landowners, corporations, and mafia-linked interests. After seizing power, the revolutionary government nationalised major industries, redistributed land, and aligned itself with global anti-colonial movements.

## Core Transformations

- Nationalisation of major industries
- Agrarian reform, breaking up large estates
- Universal healthcare and education
- Literacy campaigns across rural areas
- Public housing and social welfare expansion
- Anti-imperialist foreign policy

## Achievements and Limitations

Cuba achieved dramatic improvements in healthcare, literacy, and life expectancy despite embargoes and resource scarcity. Debates continue about political freedoms, centralisation, and the pressures of survival under constant external pressure.
