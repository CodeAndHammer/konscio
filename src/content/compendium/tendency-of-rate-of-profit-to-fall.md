## What Is the Tendency of the Rate of Profit to Fall?

This theory argues that as capitalists invest in labour-saving technology to compete, the ratio of machinery to workers increases. Since only labour creates surplus value according to Marx, this raises capital investment while limiting value creation, squeezing profit rates and generating periodic crises.

## Historical Context

Marx developed this as a law of capitalist motion explaining recurring crises, arguing capitalism contains internal contradictions causing its breakdown. Debates continue over whether empirical evidence supports the tendency and whether counteracting factors can indefinitely offset it.

## Key Dynamics

- Competition forces technological investment
- Rising capital investment relative to labour
- Declining surplus value relative to total capital
- Falling profit rates pressuring system-wide crisis
- Responses include intensified exploitation, financialisation, imperial expansion

## Counteracting Tendencies

- Increasing exploitation of workers
- Cheapening constant capital through productivity
- Expansion into new markets and territories
- Destruction of capital during crises restoring profitability

## Relationship to Other Concepts

This tendency explains capitalism's crisis-prone nature and drives [imperialism](/compendium/imperialism) as capital seeks higher returns abroad. It motivates [financialisation](/compendium/financialisation) as capital shifts from production. [Overproduction](/compendium/overproduction) crises emerge partly from profit rate pressures. [Socialism](/compendium/socialism) could transcend profit-driven production entirely.
