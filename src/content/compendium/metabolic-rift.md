## What Is the Metabolic Rift?

Metabolic rift describes how capitalism breaks the循环 circulation of nutrients, energy, and materials between human societies and their environments. By treating nature as an infinite resource sink and prioritising profit over ecological balance, capitalism creates systematic environmental degradation.

## Historical Context

Marx identified this concept analysing 19th-century soil depletion, as nutrients extracted through agriculture were not returned to the land but shipped to cities as food. Contemporary scholars extended this framework to analyse climate breakdown, biodiversity collapse, and pollution crises.

## Key Dynamics

- Separation of production from ecological regeneration
- Extraction that exceeds natural replenishment rates
- Spatial rifts moving environmental harm to distant regions
- Temporal rifts imposing costs on future generations

## Modern Examples

- Industrial agriculture depleting soil and aquifers
- Fossil fuel combustion disrupting carbon cycles
- Mining tailings and chemical contamination
- Plastic pollution overwhelming natural decomposition
- Fast fashion creating textile waste crises

## Relationship to Other Concepts

The metabolic rift is central to [eco-socialism](/compendium/eco-socialism), which argues only [social ownership](/compendium/social-ownership) and [democratic planning](/compendium/democratic-planning) can repair these ruptures. [Extractivism](/compendium/extractivism) exemplifies the rift in colonial contexts. Addressing it requires [just transition](/compendium/just-transition) and respecting [planetary boundaries](/compendium/planetary-boundaries).
