## What Is Class Consciousness?

Class consciousness means recognising that individual struggles at work, over rent, or with debt are connected through shared exploitation by the owning class. It transforms isolated grievances into political understanding and collective action.

## Historical Context

Marx distinguished between a "class in itself" (objective economic position) and a "class for itself" (subjective political awareness). Major strikes, revolutionary periods, and mass movements demonstrate moments when class consciousness intensifies across populations.

## Key Dimensions

- Recognising shared interests with other workers
- Understanding exploitation as systemic, not individual
- Identifying antagonism with the owning class
- Seeing potential for collective transformation

## How It Develops

- Through workplace organising and strikes
- During economic crises that expose systemic failures
- Via political education and movement building
- When state violence reveals whose interests it protects

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Class consciousness is essential for effective [class struggle](/compendium/class-struggle) and building [socialism](/compendium/socialism). [False consciousness](/compendium/false-consciousness) obscures it through ideology. [Praxis](/compendium/praxis) develops it through combining analysis and action. [Vanguard parties](/compendium/vanguard-party) historically aimed to accelerate its emergence.
