## What Is Dual Power?

Dual power describes moments when revolutionary organisations create parallel institutions that exercise authority alongside or against the existing state. These alternative structures—councils, assemblies, militias, or cooperative networks—demonstrate the possibility of different social organisation while directly contesting state legitimacy.

## Historical Context

Lenin identified dual power during the Russian Revolution when workers' soviets operated alongside the provisional government. Similar dynamics appeared in the Paris Commune, Spanish Revolution, and moments of revolutionary upheaval where popular assemblies assumed governance functions before state consolidation.

## Key Characteristics

- Competing sources of legitimacy and authority
- Popular institutions meeting immediate needs
- Prefigurative forms of post-revolutionary organisation
- Unstable equilibrium resolved through confrontation

## Modern Examples

- Autonomous zones during uprisings
- Zapatista autonomous municipalities in Mexico
- Rojava's democratic confederalism in Syria
- Neighbourhood councils during Argentine economic collapse
