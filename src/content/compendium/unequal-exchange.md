## What Is Unequal Exchange?

Unequal exchange describes how goods from the Global South are exchanged on terms that systematically benefit the Global North. Labour and resources in poorer regions are valued far below their real cost, allowing wealth to flow upward in the global system.

## Historical Context

The concept was developed by dependency theorists and world-systems analysts to explain why post-colonial states remain economically dependent on former empires. It continues today through trade rules, resource extraction, and global supply chains.

## Key Principles

- Low prices for raw materials
- Higher prices for finished goods
- Restrictive trade structures
- Value extraction through global supply chains
- Weak bargaining power for peripheral countries

## Modern Examples

- Cobalt exported cheaply, returned as expensive electronics
- Agricultural products traded at prices below the cost of production
- Apparel factories captured in “race to the bottom” competition

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Unequal exchange reinforces [imperialism](/compendium/imperialism) and the core–periphery divide that shapes global capitalism.
