## What Is Rent-Seeking?

Rent-seeking describes gaining wealth by controlling access to resources, property, or privileges rather than producing goods or services. Unlike profit from investment in production, rent extracts value created by others simply through ownership claims or monopoly power.

## Historical Context

Classical political economists distinguished productive from unproductive activities, criticizing landlords who enriched themselves without contributing to wealth creation. Marx analyzed ground rent as exploitation of both agricultural workers and industrial capitalists. Contemporary economists identify expanding rent-seeking across modern capitalism.

## Forms of Rent

- Land and property rents from ownership
- Intellectual property monopolies on knowledge and culture
- Natural resource extraction rights
- Financial returns from debt and speculation
- Monopoly pricing power in markets

## Modern Examples

- Pharmaceutical patents preventing generic medicine
- Tech platforms extracting fees from users and producers
- Landlords capturing rising property values they didn't create
- Financial institutions profiting from debt servicing

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Rent-seeking exemplifies [financialisation](/compendium/financialisation) and extraction without production. It intensifies under [neoliberalism](/compendium/neoliberalism) through privatisation of [commons](/compendium/commons). [Accumulation by dispossession](/compendium/accumulation-by-dispossession) often enables rent-seeking. [Social ownership](/compendium/social-ownership) could redirect rent toward [public goods](/compendium/public-goods).
