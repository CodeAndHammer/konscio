## What Is Primitive Accumulation?

Primitive accumulation describes the original, often brutal dispossession that created capitalism by forcing people into wage labour and concentrating productive resources as capital. Marx identified this as the "prehistory" of capital, though scholars now recognize it as ongoing rather than a one-time event.

## Historical Context

Marx analysed enclosures in England where peasants lost common land access, colonial conquest that extracted wealth and enslaved populations, and legal violence establishing private property. These processes transformed self-sufficient producers into propertyless workers dependent on selling their labour.

## Key Mechanisms

- Enclosure of common lands
- Colonial conquest and slavery
- Debt dispossession
- Legal redefinition of property rights
- State violence enforcing new relations

## Modern Forms

Contemporary scholars identify ongoing primitive accumulation through land grabs, privatisation of public resources, displacement of Indigenous peoples, structural adjustment programs, and intellectual property regimes. This process continues generating capitalist expansion.

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Primitive accumulation created conditions for [wage labour](/compendium/wage-labour) and [capital accumulation](/compendium/capital-accumulation). [Accumulation by dispossession](/compendium/accumulation-by-dispossession) extends this concept to contemporary capitalism. [Extractivism](/compendium/extractivism) and [neocolonialism](/compendium/neocolonialism) perpetuate primitive accumulation globally. [Decolonisation](/compendium/decolonisation) requires reversing this historical theft.
