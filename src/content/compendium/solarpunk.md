## What Is Solarpunk?

Solarpunk envisions futures where humanity lives in harmony with ecosystems through community-controlled renewable energy, rewilded landscapes, democratic technology, and cooperative social relations. As both aesthetic and political project, it offers hopeful alternatives to capitalist dystopia and climate despair.

## Historical Context

Emerging in the 2010s as a response to cyberpunk's corporate dystopias and climate anxiety, solarpunk drew from appropriate technology movements, eco-socialist theory, and Global South struggles for technological sovereignty. It combines speculative fiction, visual art, and practical organising.
