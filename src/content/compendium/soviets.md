## What Are Soviets?

Soviets were grassroots councils formed by workers, peasants, and soldiers during the Russian revolutions of 1905 and 1917. Delegates were elected directly from workplaces and military units, and they could be recalled at any time. Soviets combined political and economic decision-making in one structure.

## Historical Context

The first soviets emerged spontaneously in 1905 during a wave of strikes and unrest. In 1917, they spread across the country and became central to the revolutionary process. After the October Revolution, the soviets formed the basis of the new government, though their autonomy later declined due to civil war, centralisation, and party consolidation.

## Key Features

- Elected delegates drawn from workers, peasants, and soldiers
- Instant recallability
- Decision-making rooted in workplaces and communities
- Coordination of strikes, production, and local administration
- A form of democratic power outside parliamentary systems

## Modern Significance

Soviets are often referenced as examples of direct worker democracy and as historical instances of [dual power](/compendium/dual-power), where new institutions challenge the authority of the traditional state.

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Soviets relate closely to [democratic planning](/compendium/democratic-planning), [class struggle](/compendium/class-struggle), and the socialist critique of parliamentary representation.
