## What Is a Just Transition?

A Just Transition describes a society-wide shift away from destructive economic structures — fossil fuels, extractivism, polluting industries, precarious labour — in ways that uphold dignity, equality, and collective well-being. It ensures that structural change does not sacrifice workers or frontline communities.

Instead of leaving people behind, a Just Transition builds new systems of care, livelihood, and ecological repair.

## Historical Context

The concept emerged from labour unions in the late 20th century, particularly in industries facing collapse or technological change. Environmental justice movements expanded it, arguing that transition must address racial inequality, colonial extraction, and chronic underinvestment in vulnerable regions.

Today, Just Transition is central to climate justice, economic planning, and transformative policy frameworks.

## Key Principles

- Protecting workers and communities through income guarantees, retraining, and stable livelihoods.
- Building new public systems in energy, transport, land use, and social care.
- Ending sacrifice zones where pollution is concentrated in poor or racialised communities.
- Investing in ecological restoration and community well-being.
- Democratic participation in shaping the transition.

## Modern Examples

- Corporate closures replaced by worker cooperatives
- Regional transition authorities for post-coal economies
- Public job guarantees in conservation, care work, and restoration
- Social protection systems ensuring no one falls through the cracks

## Relationship to Other Concepts

This concept applies across sectors — energy, agriculture, transport, manufacturing, land, and care work. For the version specific to energy systems, see [Just Energy Transition](/compendium/just-energy-transition).
