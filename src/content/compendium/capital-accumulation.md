## What Is Capital Accumulation?

Capital accumulation is how capital grows through profit. Owners extract surplus from workers and reinvest it to expand production, acquire assets, and increase market power. This cycle is essential to capitalism’s survival.

## Historical Context

For Marx, accumulation was not just a business strategy but the engine of capitalist society. It explains why capitalism must expand endlessly, regardless of social or ecological limits.

## Key Principles

- Surplus-value drives accumulation.
- Competition forces constant reinvestment.
- Expansion requires new markets, new resources, and new labour.
- Inequality grows as capital centralises in fewer hands.

## Modern Examples

- Corporations buying competitors to dominate markets
- Investment funds acquiring housing as an asset
- Mining companies expanding operations to maintain profits
- Tech companies scaling globally to capture data and users

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Capital accumulation fuels ecological collapse, making a sustainable world impossible under the capitalist model of growth.
