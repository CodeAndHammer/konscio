## What Are Modes of Production?

Modes of production describe how societies organise the creation of goods and services. Each mode combines productive forces (technology, tools, labour) with relations of production (ownership, class relations, obligations). Together, they determine how society is structured and who holds power.

## Historical Context

Marx identified several main modes of production — including primitive communism, slavery, feudalism, capitalism, and socialism — each marked by specific class relations. Transitions occur when productive forces outgrow the old relations, creating tension and upheaval.

## Key Principles

- Productive forces shape the possibilities of a society.
- Relations of production determine how resources and labour are organised.
- Class struggle is central to transitions between modes.
- Contradiction between forces and relations drives historical change.

## Examples

- Feudalism: Lords hold land; peasants owe labour or rent.
- Capitalism: Private owners control the [means of production](/compendium/means-of-production); workers sell labour.
- Socialism: Major resources are socially owned and democratically controlled.

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Modes of production underpin [historical materialism](/compendium/historical-materialism), [class struggle](/compendium/class-struggle), and [capitalism](/compendium/capitalism).
