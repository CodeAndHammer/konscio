## What Is Zapatismo?

Zapatismo refers to the political philosophy and practice of the EZLN (Zapatista Army of National Liberation), an Indigenous-led movement that rose publicly in 1994 against neoliberal reforms in Mexico. Rather than seeking state power, Zapatistas built autonomous communities governed by assemblies.

## Historical Context

On the day the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) took effect, the EZLN declared that neoliberalism threatened Indigenous land rights, food security, and self-determination. The movement combined Indigenous traditions, anti-capitalist politics, and grassroots democracy.

## Core Principles

- Community assemblies governing democratically
- Collective land ownership
- Resistance to neoliberal reforms and dispossession
- Indigenous self-determination
- Rejection of elite politics in favour of autonomy
- Emphasis on education, health, and gender equality

## Modern Significance

Zapatismo remains a living example of autonomous governance, land stewardship, and bottom-up political organisation. Their communes operate schools, clinics, cooperatives, and decision-making structures independent from the Mexican state.
