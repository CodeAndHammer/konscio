## What Is Land Back?

Land Back is a political and cultural movement that calls for returning land to Indigenous communities. It challenges colonial land theft, ongoing dispossession, and the extraction-driven systems imposed on Indigenous territories.

## Historical Context

Indigenous peoples worldwide were displaced through conquest, treaties, forced removals, and resource grabs. Land Back responds to these historical injustices and asserts the right to self-governance and cultural survival.

## Key Principles

- Restoration of land and sovereignty
- Community-led stewardship
- Protection of ecosystems
- Revival of Indigenous governance systems
- Rejection of extractive colonial economies

## Modern Examples

- Indigenous nations reclaiming forests and conservation areas
- Campaigns against pipelines and mining projects
- Community-based ecological restoration
- Legal and political movements to overturn colonial land regimes

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Land Back aligns with eco-socialism by emphasising ecological care, collective ownership, and resistance to extractivism.
