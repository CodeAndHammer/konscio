## What Is a General Strike?

A general strike involves workers across an entire economy simultaneously refusing to work, shutting down production and services to force political or economic concessions. It represents the working class exercising collective power by withholding the labour that makes society function.

## Historical Context

General strikes emerged in late 19th-century labour movements as workers recognized their ability to paralyze economies. Major examples include the 1926 British General Strike, 1936 French general strike, and more recently mass strikes in France, India, and elsewhere. Some revolutionaries saw it as path to overthrowing capitalism itself.

## Key Characteristics

- Coordinated action across industries
- Political or economic demands
- Disruption of capitalist production
- Demonstration of working-class solidarity
- Challenge to state and employer power

## Modern Examples

- Indian general strikes involving hundreds of millions
- French strikes against pension reforms
- Chilean general strike during 2019 uprising
- Various national strikes against austerity measures

## Relationship to Other Concepts

General strikes demonstrate working-class power central to [socialism](/compendium/socialism) and [class struggle](/compendium/class-struggle). They require [class consciousness](/compendium/class-consciousness) and organisation. Some theorists linked general strikes to creating [dual power](/compendium/dual-power) and revolutionary transformation. [Workers' control](/compendium/workers-control) experiments sometimes emerged from strike occupations.
