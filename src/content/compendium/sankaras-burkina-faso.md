## What Was Sankara’s Burkina Faso?

From 1983 to 1987, Thomas Sankara led a revolutionary government in Burkina Faso, renaming the country from Upper Volta and launching sweeping reforms aimed at autonomy, dignity, and ecological repair. His government prioritised mass participation, social equality, and independence from foreign control.

## Historical Context

Burkina Faso faced severe poverty, neocolonial dependency, and environmental degradation. Sankara drew from Marxist, pan-African, and ecological ideas to build a sovereign, people-centered model of development.

## Core Transformations

- Mass vaccination and literacy campaigns
- Land redistribution and food self-sufficiency
- Reforestation and anti-desertification programs
- Major women's rights reforms
- Strict anti-corruption measures
- Use of local production over imported goods
- Community mobilisation through popular committees

## Legacy

Sankara’s assassination in 1987 ended the revolution, but his example remains a touchstone for eco-socialist, anti-imperialist, and pan-African movements.
