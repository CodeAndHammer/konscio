## What Is the Dictatorship of the Proletariat?

The dictatorship of the proletariat describes the political phase between capitalism and communism in which workers collectively exercise state power to dismantle capitalist relations and resist counter-revolution. Despite the term, it refers to democratic working-class rule, not authoritarian control.

## Historical Context

Marx used this term to describe the Paris Commune's brief experiment in worker democracy. Lenin further developed it during the Russian Revolution, though implementation varied widely across 20th-century socialist movements, with authoritarian distortions often undermining democratic intentions.

## Key Principles

- Working-class control of the state apparatus
- Suppression of counter-revolutionary forces
- Reorganisation of production and distribution
- Gradual transition toward classless society

## Modern Debates

Contemporary socialists debate whether a transitional state is necessary, how to prevent bureaucratic capture, and what democratic forms working-class power should take. Some emphasise [soviets](/compendium/soviets) and participatory councils, others focus on [dual power](/compendium/dual-power) and prefigurative institutions.

## Relationship to Other Concepts

This concept assumes [class struggle](/compendium/class-struggle) continues after revolution as capitalist classes resist expropriation. It requires transforming the [state](/compendium/the-state) from an instrument of bourgeois rule into one serving working-class interests, ultimately leading to [communism](/compendium/communism) where the state itself withers away.
