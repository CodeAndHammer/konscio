## What Is Food Sovereignty?

Food sovereignty asserts that communities should control how food is grown, processed, and distributed rather than being subject to corporate agribusiness and global commodity markets. It emphasises ecological farming methods, cultural food traditions, and democratic decision-making over production.

## Historical Context

The concept emerged from peasant movements, particularly La Vía Campesina, responding to trade liberalisation and corporate control of agriculture in the 1990s. It built on agrarian reform struggles and Indigenous land defence movements asserting autonomy over territories and resources.

## Key Principles

- Democratic control over food systems
- Agroecological farming practices
- Support for small-scale producers
- Fair prices for farmers and consumers
- Cultural food traditions respected
- Resistance to corporate seed and chemical monopolies

## Modern Expressions

- Community-supported agriculture networks
- Seed saving and exchange initiatives
- Urban farming cooperatives
- Indigenous-led land stewardship
- Campaigns against land grabs and GMO patents

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Food sovereignty connects to [indigenous sovereignty](/compendium/indigenous-sovereignty) and [land back](/compendium/land-back) movements asserting territorial control. It opposes [extractivism](/compendium/extractivism) in agriculture and requires [social ownership](/compendium/social-ownership) of land. [Eco-socialism](/compendium/eco-socialism) includes food sovereignty as essential to just and sustainable societies.
