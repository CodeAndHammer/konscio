## What Is Internationalism?

Internationalism asserts that working-class liberation requires solidarity across nations, as capital operates globally and uses nationalism to divide workers. It opposes both capitalist globalisation and reactionary nationalism with a vision of democratic coordination across borders.

## Historical Context

Marx's call that "workers of the world unite" recognised that capital would pit workers in different countries against each other. The International Workingmen's Association, Communist International, and various anti-colonial solidarity movements embodied internationalist organising, though often with tensions and contradictions.

## Key Principles

- Working-class interests transcend borders
- Opposition to imperialist wars
- Solidarity with liberation struggles
- Rejection of nationalist scapegoating
- Coordination across national labour movements

## Modern Expressions

- Cross-border union organising against multinationals
- Climate justice movements linking Global North and South
- Boycotts and sanctions against apartheid and occupation
- Mutual aid between movements facing similar struggles

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Internationalism requires [anti-imperialism](/compendium/anti-imperialism) and challenges nationalism used to divide workers. It connects to [tricontinentalism](/compendium/tricontinentalism) and [decolonisation](/compendium/decolonisation) struggles. [Neocolonialism](/compendium/neocolonialism) and [unequal exchange](/compendium/unequal-exchange) demonstrate why internationalism must address Global North complicity in exploitation.
