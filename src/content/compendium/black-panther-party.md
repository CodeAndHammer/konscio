## What Was the Black Panther Party?

Founded in 1966 in Oakland, the Black Panther Party (BPP) combined Black liberation politics, socialist principles, and community self-defence. They challenged police violence, segregation, and economic oppression.

## Historical Context

The BPP emerged during the civil rights era but rejected purely integrationist approaches. They argued that Black liberation required confronting capitalism, racism, imperialism, and state power.

## Core Practices

- Community survival programs (free breakfast, clinics, housing aid)
- Armed patrols monitoring police abuses
- Political education classes
- Alliances with labour, anti-war, and socialist groups
- International solidarity with anti-colonial movements

## Legacy

Despite severe repression, the BPP reshaped political thought in the US, influencing movements on policing, healthcare, education, and racial justice. Their community programs prefigured models of mutual aid and public provisioning.

## Relationship to Other Concepts

The BPP intersects with [mutual aid](/compendium/mutual-aid), [anti-imperialism](/compendium/anti-imperialism), and critiques of the capitalist state.
