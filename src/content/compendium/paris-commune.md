## What Was the Paris Commune?

The Paris Commune was a radical experiment in democratic worker rule that governed Paris from March to May 1871. It emerged when workers, artisans, National Guard units, and neighbourhood committees refused to accept the return of France’s conservative government after the Franco-Prussian War.

The Commune reorganised political and economic life around direct democracy, popular control, and social equality.

## Historical Context

After France’s defeat, the government sought to disarm the Parisian National Guard. Workers rebelled, seized control of the city, and established a new political order. Though it lasted only 72 days before being violently crushed, the Commune became a defining symbol of working-class power.

## Key Principles

- Elected, recallable delegates accountable to the people
- Separation of church and state
- Worker control of abandoned or seized workplaces
- Abolition of conscription
- Reduction of bureaucratic privilege
- Neighbourhood-based democracy

## Modern Significance

The Commune is often cited by socialists, anarchists, and communalists as a real-world example of democratic self-governance. It influenced Marx’s understanding of the state, Lenin’s conception of soviets, and modern experiments in participatory democracy.
