## What Are the Proletariat and Bourgeoisie?

The proletariat comprises workers who must sell their labour power to survive, owning little beyond their capacity to work. The bourgeoisie owns the [means of production](/compendium/means-of-production) and purchases labour to generate profit. This relationship defines capitalist social relations.

## Historical Context

These classes emerged through industrialisation as feudal peasants and artisans became wage workers, while merchants and proto-industrialists consolidated ownership of factories, land, and capital. Marx identified this antagonism as capitalism's central contradiction.

## Key Principles

- The proletariat creates value through labour
- The bourgeoisie appropriates [surplus value](/compendium/surplus-value)
- Their interests are fundamentally opposed
- This conflict drives historical change

## Modern Complexity

Contemporary capitalism includes managerial classes, precarious gig workers, the unemployed, and global supply chains that complicate class categories. Yet the fundamental division between those who must work for wages and those who profit from others' labour persists.

## Relationship to Other Concepts

[Class struggle](/compendium/class-struggle) between these groups shapes politics, culture, and economic development. [Class consciousness](/compendium/class-consciousness) means the proletariat recognising their collective interests. [Socialism](/compendium/socialism) aims to abolish this division by establishing [social ownership](/compendium/social-ownership) and ending wage labour.
