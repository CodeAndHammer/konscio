## What Is Energy Democracy?

Energy democracy means shifting power production and distribution from fossil fuel corporations and centralised utilities to community-controlled renewable systems. It links energy transition to economic democracy, arguing that who controls energy shapes society.

## Historical Context

As climate breakdown intensified and renewable technology improved, movements began demanding public and cooperative ownership of energy infrastructure. Struggles against coal plants, pipelines, and electricity privatisation converged with demands for community solar and municipally-owned utilities.

## Key Principles

- Public or cooperative ownership of generation and grids
- Participatory planning of energy systems
- Prioritising access over profit
- Just transition for fossil fuel workers
- Decentralised renewable generation

## Modern Examples

- Community-owned solar cooperatives
- Municipal renewable energy companies in Germany
- Bolivian nationalisation of energy with social tariffs
- Resistance to pipeline projects defending land and water

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Energy democracy is essential to [eco-socialism](/compendium/eco-socialism) and [just energy transition](/compendium/just-energy-transition). It requires [social ownership](/compendium/social-ownership) and [democratic planning](/compendium/democratic-planning) to coordinate renewable deployment. Opposing [extractivism](/compendium/extractivism) and supporting [climate justice](/compendium/climate-justice) demands democratic energy control.
