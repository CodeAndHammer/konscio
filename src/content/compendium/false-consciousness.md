## What Is False Consciousness?

False consciousness describes situations where working people adopt worldviews that justify their own exploitation or blame other oppressed groups for systemic problems. It explains how capitalism maintains legitimacy despite creating widespread suffering.

## Historical Context

Engels introduced this concept to explain why workers sometimes support political positions contrary to their class interests. Later Marxists developed it through analyses of ideology, [hegemony](/compendium/hegemony), and cultural production under capitalism.

## Key Mechanisms

- Blaming individual failure rather than systemic exploitation
- Accepting meritocracy myths that justify inequality
- Identifying with employers or national capital against fellow workers
- Scapegoating marginalised groups for economic insecurity

## Modern Examples

- Precarious workers opposing trade unions
- Low-wage workers supporting tax cuts for the wealthy
- Climate denial among those most vulnerable to ecological breakdown
- Anti-immigrant sentiment among working-class communities

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Overcoming false consciousness requires developing [class consciousness](/compendium/class-consciousness) through political education and collective struggle. [Alienation](/compendium/alienation) and [commodity fetishism](/compendium/commodity-fetishism) contribute to false consciousness by obscuring capitalist social relations. [Hegemony](/compendium/hegemony) explains how ruling classes naturalise their worldview across society.
