## What Was Allende’s Chile?

Between 1970 and 1973, President Salvador Allende led a peaceful socialist transformation known as the Popular Unity government. It expanded democratic rights, nationalised key industries, implemented land reform, and increased workers' control in workplaces.

## Historical Context

Chile experienced deep inequality and foreign corporate influence, particularly from US mining interests. Allende’s government attempted to transition toward socialism through democratic means. In 1973, a US-backed military coup led by Augusto Pinochet overthrew the government.

## Core Transformations

- Nationalisation of copper and major industries
- Land reform redistributing large estates
- Price controls on essential goods
- Workplace participation and worker councils
- Expanded healthcare and education
- Cultural programs supporting public arts

## Legacy

Allende’s project demonstrated a socialist transition through electoral and democratic paths, though it faced internal divisions, external sabotage, and intense pressure from global capital and the US government.
