## What Is Austerity?

Austerity refers to government policies that reduce public spending, social services, and welfare support in order to reduce budget deficits. It is usually justified with claims of “tightening belts,” “living within means,” or restoring investor confidence. In practice, austerity shifts the burden of economic crises onto the working class and the poor.

Austerity rarely reduces inequality; instead, it deepens it by weakening collective systems and expanding market control.

## Historical Context

Austerity has been used repeatedly throughout modern history, often after economic shocks. It expanded globally during the rise of [neoliberalism](/compendium/neoliberalism), becoming a standard prescription from international financial institutions.

After the 2008 financial crisis, many countries implemented austerity despite evidence that public investment was needed. The result was slower recovery, weakened public services, and growing resentment.

## Core Features

- Cuts to healthcare, education, housing, and social support
- Wage freezes or reductions for public sector workers
- Pension cuts and retirement age increases
- Reduced investment in infrastructure and public goods
- Increased user fees for basic services
- Prioritising debt repayment over social welfare

## Consequences

- Higher unemployment and economic stagnation
- Weakened public systems and infrastructure
- Rising poverty and food insecurity
- Reduced access to healthcare and education
- Long-term social and psychological harm
- Transfer of wealth and power to private corporations

## Austerity in the Global South

Austerity has frequently been imposed through [structural adjustment programs](/compendium/structural-adjustment-programs), limiting the ability of countries to invest in development, public services, or ecological repair.

## Relationship to Eco-Socialism

Austerity undermines the collective capacity needed for a [just transition](/compendium/just-transition) and climate resilience. Eco-socialism rejects austerity, advocating public investment, universal services, and democratic planning as essential for both social and ecological survival.
