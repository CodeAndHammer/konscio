## What Was the Bandung Conference?

The Asian-African Conference held in Bandung, Indonesia in 1955 brought together 29 newly independent nations to assert sovereignty, oppose colonialism, and chart an independent path between Cold War superpowers. It marked a pivotal moment in Global South self-organisation and anti-imperial solidarity.

## Historical Context

As decolonisation accelerated after World War II, leaders like Sukarno, Nasser, Nehru, and Zhou Enlai convened to coordinate opposition to remaining colonial rule and resist neocolonial pressures. The conference occurred amid intensifying Cold War competition for influence over newly independent states.

## Key Principles

- Respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity
- Non-aggression and non-interference
- Equality among nations
- Peaceful coexistence
- Mutual benefit in economic cooperation
- Support for national liberation movements

## Legacy

The conference inspired the Non-Aligned Movement, provided framework for South-South cooperation, and asserted the right of formerly colonised nations to determine their own futures. Its spirit influenced subsequent movements for a New International Economic Order.
