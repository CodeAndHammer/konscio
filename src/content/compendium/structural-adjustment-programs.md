## What Are Structural Adjustment Programs?

Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) are conditions attached to loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. They require countries to adopt neoliberal reforms such as privatisation, deregulation, trade liberalisation, and cuts to public spending.

SAPs reshape entire economies to align with global market interests, often at the expense of local development and social well-being.

## Historical Context

SAPs intensified in the 1980s and 1990s during the global debt crisis. Countries in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and the Caribbean were pressured into adopting these reforms to secure international loans or avoid default.

While framed as technical solutions, SAPs imposed a political project that prioritised foreign investment, export orientation, and debt repayment over the needs of local populations.

## Core Components

- Privatisation of state-owned enterprises
- Cuts in healthcare, education, and welfare
- Trade liberalisation and reduced tariffs
- Deregulation of labour markets
- Currency devaluation
- Removal of subsidies for food, fuel, and transport
- Prioritising debt repayment over domestic needs

## Consequences

- Rising poverty and unemployment
- Collapse of public healthcare and education systems
- Weakened labour rights
- Increased dependency on exports and volatile global markets
- Food insecurity and loss of local agriculture
- Long-term underdevelopment and vulnerability

## Structural Adjustment and Neocolonialism

SAPs perpetuate the dynamics of [neocolonialism](/compendium/neocolonialism) by limiting sovereignty and forcing countries into roles that serve the global economy rather than their own people. They reinforce [unequal exchange](/compendium/unequal-exchange) and the power of multinational corporations.

## Relationship to Eco-Socialism

SAPs undermine the public capacity required for ecological protection and sustainable development. They encourage extractive growth, weaken environmental regulations, and reduce investment in adaptation and public infrastructure. Eco-socialism advocates for debt cancellation, reparative finance, and democratic control over development pathways.
