## What Is a Red-Green Alliance?

Red-green alliances bring together labour movements, socialist organisations, and environmental groups, recognising that workers and ecosystems face interconnected exploitation under capitalism. These coalitions argue that neither labour rights nor ecological survival can be achieved without confronting capitalist production.

## Historical Context

As environmental movements grew in the 1970s-80s, tensions emerged between preservationists and labour unions fearing job losses. Red-green politics emerged to bridge this divide, arguing that fossil fuel companies, not workers, cause ecological destruction, and that a just transition requires both ecological limits and workers' rights.

## Key Principles

- Workers and ecosystems both exploited by capital
- Just transition protecting workers during energy shift
- Democratic control over production and resources
- Opposition to false choice between jobs and environment
- Recognition that capitalist growth drives both inequality and climate breakdown

## Modern Examples

- Trade unions campaigning for public renewable energy programs
- Climate strikes linking youth activists and labour movements
- Coalitions opposing pipelines for both ecological and Indigenous sovereignty reasons
- Green New Deal proposals combining decarbonisation with job guarantees
