## What Is Entryism?

Entryism involves revolutionary socialists joining social democratic parties, trade unions, or other reformist organisations to shift their politics leftward, recruit members to revolutionary organisations, or leverage institutional resources. It balances working within existing institutions while maintaining revolutionary objectives.

## Historical Context

Trotskyists pioneered entryism in the 1930s, joining social democratic parties to reach working-class audiences and combat fascism. The strategy gained prominence in post-war Europe as revolutionary groups entered mass labour parties. Success varied widely based on context and execution.

## Key Variants

- Long-term entry building influence gradually
- Short-term entry targeting specific campaigns
- Open entry with transparent revolutionary identity
- Secret entry concealing ultimate objectives

## Debates and Risks

Supporters argue entryism reaches workers in existing institutions. Critics warn it leads to accommodation with reformism, wastes resources on bureaucratic maneuvering, and diverts energy from independent organising. Entrists risk expulsion, cooptation, or reproducing reformist limits.

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Entryism reflects tensions between revolutionary and reformist strategies in [class struggle](/compendium/class-struggle). [Vanguard party](/compendium/vanguard-party) advocates debated when entry advanced revolutionary goals versus compromising them. Alternative strategies include [dual power](/compendium/dual-power) building institutions outside reformist structures or [popular front](/compendium/popular-front) coalitions maintaining organisational independence.
