## What Is Third Worldism?

Third Worldism argues that revolutionary potential lies primarily in colonised and formerly colonised nations of the Global South rather than in wealthy imperial core states. It contends that imperialism transfers surplus value from periphery to core, creating material interests that bind even working classes in wealthy nations to imperial projects.

## Historical Context

Emerging during decolonisation struggles of the 1950s-70s, Third Worldist analysis developed through Chinese, Vietnamese, and African revolutionary movements. Theorists like Fanon, Cabral, and Lin Biao articulated how national liberation struggles against imperialism formed the vanguard of global revolution.

## Key Arguments

- Imperialism bribes workers in wealthy nations through super-profits
- Class struggle in the core is constrained by imperial privilege
- National liberation movements challenge global capitalism
- Revolutionary organisation must center the oppressed periphery

## Contemporary Debates

Critics argue Third Worldism underestimates contradictions within imperial core states and can romanticise authoritarian regimes. Defenders contend it accurately identifies material bases of reformism in wealthy nations and the centrality of anti-imperialist struggle.
