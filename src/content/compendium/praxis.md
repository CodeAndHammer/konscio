## What Is Praxis?

Praxis describes the active relationship between understanding the world and changing it. It rejects the separation of thought from action, insisting that theory becomes meaningful only when applied, and practice becomes purposeful only when guided by analysis.

## Historical Context

Marx developed praxis as a critique of philosophers who merely interpreted the world. Revolutionary movements from the Paris Commune to liberation struggles in the Global South demonstrated how theory and organising must evolve together through lived struggle.

## Key Principles

- Theory tested through action
- Practice informed by analysis
- Collective reflection and adjustment
- Learning through struggle

## Modern Examples

- Community organising campaigns that adapt strategy based on results
- Worker cooperatives developing socialist economics in practice
- Climate justice movements linking analysis of extraction to direct resistance
- Popular education models that emerge from grassroots organising

## Relationship to Other Concepts

[Socialism](/compendium/socialism) requires praxis to move from critique to transformation. [Class consciousness](/compendium/class-consciousness) develops through praxis as workers collectively analyse and challenge their conditions. Movements practicing [mutual aid](/compendium/mutual-aid) and building [dual power](/compendium/dual-power) demonstrate praxis by creating alternatives while confronting existing systems.
