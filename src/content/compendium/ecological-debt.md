## What Is Ecological Debt?

Ecological debt refers to the reparations the Global North owes for environmental destruction, resource extraction, and disproportionate pollution causing climate breakdown. It recognises that wealthy nations built their prosperity through colonialism, fossil fuel use, and offshoring environmental harm to poorer regions.

## Historical Context

Movements in Latin America and Africa developed this concept during climate negotiations, challenging narratives that treated all nations as equally responsible for ecological crisis. They connected colonial extraction to contemporary carbon emissions and biodiversity loss.

## Components of the Debt

- Historical emissions causing climate breakdown
- Extracted resources during colonial periods
- Biopiracy of Indigenous knowledge and genetic resources
- Toxic waste dumped in Global South
- Environmental refugees displaced by Northern consumption

## Modern Demands

- Climate reparations funding adaptation in vulnerable regions
- Technology transfer for renewable energy
- Debt cancellation for climate-vulnerable nations
- Compensation for loss and damage from climate impacts

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Ecological debt analysis centers [climate justice](/compendium/climate-justice) and [anti-imperialism](/compendium/anti-imperialism). It exposes [unequal exchange](/compendium/unequal-exchange) and [extractivism](/compendium/extractivism) as ongoing exploitation. [Decolonisation](/compendium/decolonisation) must include ecological reparations, making ecological debt central to [eco-socialism](/compendium/eco-socialism).
