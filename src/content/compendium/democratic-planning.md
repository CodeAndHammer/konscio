## What Is Democratic Planning?

Democratic planning replaces market competition with cooperative, participatory decision-making. Communities, workers, and public institutions coordinate economic activity through transparent processes rather than corporate control.

## Historical Context

Planning has existed in many forms, from early socialist experiments to modern participatory budgeting. Today, global crises highlight the need for coordinated systems that markets cannot deliver.

## Key Principles

- Participatory decision-making
- Community and worker control
- Production for need, not profit
- Transparency in economic choices
- Long-term ecological planning

## Modern Examples

- Participatory budgeting in cities
- Worker-managed factories and cooperatives
- Public energy authorities coordinating renewable rollout
- Food system planning through agroecology networks

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Democratic planning is a practical expression of [social ownership](/compendium/social-ownership) and a critical alternative to capitalist market chaos.
