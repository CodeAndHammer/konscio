## What Is Anti-Imperialism?

Anti-imperialism challenges political, military, and economic domination exercised by powerful states over weaker regions. It insists that nations have the right to determine their own future without external coercion.

## Historical Context

Anti-imperialism was central to 20th-century liberation movements across Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. It remains relevant as modern [neocolonialism](/compendium/neocolonialism) uses debt, trade, and extraction instead of direct rule.

## Key Principles

- National sovereignty
- Opposition to foreign military intervention
- Control over land and resources
- Solidarity with liberation movements
- Resistance to global corporate power

## Modern Examples

- Struggles against mining concessions imposed by foreign powers
- Movements resisting military bases in the Global South
- Fights for control of critical minerals
- Opposition to IMF and World Bank structural programs

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Eco-socialism identifies imperialism as a key driver of extraction, climate breakdown, and global inequality.
