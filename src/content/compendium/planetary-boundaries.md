## What Are Planetary Boundaries?

Planetary boundaries are ecological thresholds that, once crossed, risk destabilising Earth’s systems. They include climate, biodiversity, freshwater, land use, ocean chemistry, and more. Staying within these limits is essential for a stable and livable planet.

## Historical Context

Developed by Earth system scientists, the framework shows that the capitalist model of endless growth has already pushed several boundaries past safe limits.

## Key Principles

- Finite ecological limits
- Interconnected environmental systems
- Irreversible tipping points
- Human activity as a destabilising force

## Modern Examples

- Exceeding safe levels of greenhouse gases
- Mass extinction and biodiversity collapse
- Ocean acidification
- Soil depletion and deforestation

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Planetary boundaries reinforce the eco-socialist argument that a system based on infinite growth contradicts ecological reality. A sustainable future requires democratic, post-extractive economic planning.
