## What Is a Steady-State Economy?

A steady-state economy maintains a relatively constant stock of physical wealth and population, prioritising qualitative improvement over quantitative expansion. It recognises that infinite growth on a finite planet is impossible and that exceeding ecological limits threatens human survival.

## Historical Context

Ecological economists developed this concept critiquing growthism in the 1970s as environmental crises intensified. Indigenous societies have long practiced steady-state principles, maintaining populations and resource use within local ecosystems' regenerative capacity.

## Key Principles

- Production matched to ecological regeneration
- Focus on wellbeing rather than GDP growth
- Redistribution of existing wealth instead of expansion
- Renewable energy within sustainable yields
- Circular material flows minimising waste

## Modern Proposals

- Universal basic services funded by wealth taxes
- Reduced working hours with maintained living standards
- Repair culture replacing planned obsolescence
- Localised production reducing transport emissions

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Steady-state economics aligns with [eco-socialism](/compendium/eco-socialism) and [degrowth](/compendium/degrowth) critiques of capitalist expansion. It requires [democratic planning](/compendium/democratic-planning) to coordinate production within [planetary boundaries](/compendium/planetary-boundaries). [Social ownership](/compendium/social-ownership) enables prioritising stability over profit-driven growth.
