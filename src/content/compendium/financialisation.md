## What Is Financialisation?

Financialisation describes how finance increasingly shapes economic activity, corporate decisions, and household life. Profits increasingly come from financial channels rather than production, while debt becomes central to accessing housing, education, and basic needs.

## Historical Context

Since the 1970s, as profitability in manufacturing declined in wealthy nations, capital increasingly shifted toward financial speculation, real estate, and debt instruments. Deregulation enabled financial expansion, with finance sector profits growing from 10% to over 40% of total corporate profits in the US.

## Key Dimensions

- Corporate focus on shareholder value over production
- Household dependence on debt for basic needs
- Real estate as financial asset rather than housing
- Speculative trading dominating markets
- Public services privatised and securitised

## Modern Examples

- Student debt exceeding a trillion dollars in the US
- Housing bubbles pricing out working people
- Private equity extracting value from healthcare and care work
- Sovereign debt constraining public spending

## Relationship to Other Concepts

It intensifies [neoliberalism](/compendium/neoliberalism) through privatisation and debt. [Austerity](/compendium/austerity) serves financial interests by prioritising debt repayment.
