## What Is a Popular Front?

Popular fronts bring together communists, socialists, liberals, and other anti-fascist forces in united political action while each organisation maintains separate identity and program. The strategy prioritises defeating immediate reactionary threats through electoral and extraparliamentary coordination.

## Historical Context

Communist parties adopted popular front strategy in the 1930s responding to fascism's rise in Europe. Fronts formed in France, Spain, and Chile combined diverse forces against far-right movements. Spain's Republican coalition during the civil war became the most famous and tragic example.

## Key Principles

- Unity against common reactionary enemy
- Organisational independence maintained
- Electoral and movement coordination
- Democratic rather than revolutionary immediate goals
- Temporary alliance around specific threats

## Debates and Tensions

Supporters argue popular fronts prevented fascist victories and protected working-class organisations. Critics contend they subordinated revolutionary goals to liberal allies, demobilised militant action, and ultimately failed to stop reaction. Spain's defeat reinforced these tensions.

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Popular fronts differ from [vanguard party](/compendium/vanguard-party) strategy emphasizing independent revolutionary organisation. They relate to [entryism](/compendium/entryism) debates about working with reformists. Contemporary anti-fascist and [red-green alliances](/compendium/red-green-alliance) face similar strategic questions about coalition breadth versus political clarity.
