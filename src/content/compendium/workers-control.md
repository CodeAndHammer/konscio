## What Is Workers' Control?

Workers' control means employees collectively managing enterprises, making decisions about production, distribution, and workplace conditions without capitalist owners or hierarchical management. It ranges from limited participation in management to full worker self-management of production.

## Historical Context

Workers' control emerged during revolutionary periods when workers occupied factories—Russia 1917, Italy 1920, Spain 1936, Argentina 2001. Some experiments like Mondragon cooperatives sustained worker management for decades. It represents [praxis](/compendium/praxis) demonstrating alternatives to capitalist production.

## Forms and Degrees

- Worker representation on management boards
- Collective determination of production decisions
- Democratic election of coordinators
- Full self-management without separate management
- Networked coordination between worker-controlled enterprises

## Modern Examples

- Argentine worker-recovered factories during economic collapse
- Venezuelan communal councils and worker cooperatives
- Cooperation Jackson building solidarity economy in Mississippi
- Platform cooperatives developing worker-owned alternatives to gig platforms

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Workers' control demonstrates [social ownership](/compendium/social-ownership) and [democratic planning](/compendium/democratic-planning) possibilities. It emerges from [class struggle](/compendium/class-struggle) and can create [dual power](/compendium/dual-power). [Socialism](/compendium/socialism) requires generalizing workers' control across the economy. It overcomes [alienation](/compendium/alienation) by returning control over labour to workers themselves.
