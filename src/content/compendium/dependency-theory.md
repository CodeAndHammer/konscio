## What Is Dependency Theory?

Dependency theory explains persistent poverty in the Global South not through internal deficiencies but through international economic structures designed to transfer wealth to wealthy nations. It challenges modernisation narratives claiming all countries follow the same development path.

## Historical Context

Latin American economists like Raúl Prebisch and Andre Gunder Frank developed dependency theory in the 1960s, analysing how colonial-era extraction evolved into economic neocolonialism after formal independence. They showed that "free trade" perpetuates unequal exchange.

## Key Mechanisms

- Commodity export dependence on volatile global prices
- Import of manufactured goods at higher prices
- Capital flight and debt servicing
- Technology monopolies controlling production methods
- Trade rules favouring industrial economies

## Modern Manifestations

- Structural adjustment programs imposing austerity
- Land grabs by foreign investors
- Tax havens enabling profit extraction
- Patent regimes preventing technology transfer

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Dependency theory explains [neocolonialism](/compendium/neocolonialism) and [unequal exchange](/compendium/unequal-exchange) mechanisms. It underpins [anti-imperialism](/compendium/anti-imperialism) and [decolonisation](/compendium/decolonisation) demands. [Structural adjustment programs](/compendium/structural-adjustment-programs) exemplify dependency's institutional enforcement. [Third Worldism](/compendium/third-worldism) builds on dependency analysis.
