## What Is a Just Energy Transition?

A Just Energy Transition focuses specifically on transforming the energy system. It ensures that the move from fossil fuels to renewable energy does not repeat the harms of extractivism, corporate control, or colonial domination. It centres workers, frontline communities, and Indigenous land rights.

Unlike generic “decarbonisation,” this approach demands democratic ownership, ecological care, and justice in every stage of the energy shift.

## Historical Context

As renewable technologies expanded, it became clear that energy transitions can themselves be unjust. Mining for critical minerals, land grabs for solar and wind projects, and mass layoffs in fossil sectors often mirror older extractive systems. Climate justice movements pushed for an alternative rooted in equity and community power.

## Key Principles

- Fair treatment for fossil fuel workers, including retraining, wage protection, and new livelihoods.
- Democratic control of energy, including public utilities, community grids, and cooperatives.
- Respect for Indigenous sovereignty in all energy siting decisions.
- Ending extractive energy models, including green colonialism and mineral exploitation.
- Localised, sustainable energy systems aligned with ecological limits.

## Modern Examples

- Community-owned wind and solar cooperatives
- Publicly funded retraining for coal and gas workers
- Indigenous-led renewable projects
- Municipal utilities planning long-term decarbonisation
- Opposition to lithium extraction on sacred and fragile lands

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Just Energy Transition is a subset of [Just Transition](/compendium/just-transition), applying its principles directly to the shift away from fossil fuels.
