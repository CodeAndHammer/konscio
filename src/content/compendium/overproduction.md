## What Is Overproduction?

Overproduction occurs when capitalists, competing to maximize profits, collectively produce more goods than can be sold at prices covering costs and generating profit. This creates crises as businesses fail, workers lose jobs, and purchasing power further declines, deepening the contradiction.

## Historical Context

Marx identified overproduction as a fundamental capitalist contradiction: production for profit rather than need creates systematic gluts. The 1930s Great Depression exemplified massive overproduction as factories shuttered despite widespread unmet needs. Keynesian policies attempted managing this through demand stimulation.

## Key Contradictions

- Production driven by profit, not social need
- Competition pushing output beyond market capacity
- Workers' wages insufficient to purchase output
- Resulting crises destroying productive capacity

## Relationship to Underconsumption

Some Marxists emphasize underconsumption—workers' insufficient purchasing power—as the primary issue, while others stress overaccumulation of capital relative to profitable investment opportunities. Both reflect capitalism's anarchic, unplanned character.

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Overproduction crises demonstrate contradictions in [capitalism](/compendium/capitalism) between socialized production and private appropriation. They connect to the [tendency of the rate of profit to fall](/compendium/tendency-of-rate-of-profit-to-fall) as both drive cyclical crises. [Democratic planning](/compendium/democratic-planning) under [socialism](/compendium/socialism) could coordinate production with social needs rather than profit.
