## What Is Indigenous Sovereignty?

Indigenous sovereignty refers to the authority of Indigenous nations to govern themselves, maintain cultural practices, manage land and resources, and determine their own destinies. It predates colonial states and persists despite attempts to erase it.

## Historical Context

Colonial powers denied Indigenous sovereignty through treaties, assimilation, forced removals, and territorial claiming. Today, Indigenous nations continue to assert sovereignty through legal battles, direct action, and cultural renewal.

## Key Principles

- Self-determination
- Land as living relationship, not property
- Cultural continuity and resurgence
- Community-led governance
- Resistance to extractive colonial systems

## Modern Examples

- Sovereign Indigenous governance in conservation zones
- Co-management of ecological areas
- Resistance to oil and mining projects
- Independent political structures outside nation-states

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Indigenous sovereignty strengthens eco-socialist visions of democratic land stewardship, ecological care, and post-extractive futures.
