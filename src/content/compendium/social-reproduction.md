## What Is Social Reproduction?

Social reproduction includes all activities that maintain and reproduce human life: caregiving, childcare, elder care, education, cooking, emotional support, and community organisation. Much of this work is unpaid or low-paid and disproportionately performed by women.

## Historical Context

Feminist and Marxist scholars expanded the concept to show how capitalism relies on hidden labour outside the waged economy. Without socially reproductive labour, no workforce could exist.

## Key Principles

- Life-making labour
- Gendered division of labour
- Undervalued or unpaid work
- Essential to economic systems
- Central to human well-being

## Modern Examples

- Domestic work and care economies
- Public education and healthcare
- Community mutual aid
- Informal caregiving networks

## Relationship to Other Concepts

Socialism seeks to make reproductive labour visible, valued, and collectively supported through universal public services and democratic planning.
